*In this report, I will explore an Airbnb listings dataset to understand the short-term homestays market in Hawaii. To achieve this, I will apply a set of descriptive statistics and communicate my findings with data visualisations.*\
Recently, Hawaii has caught my attention and become my number one place to visit for a lifetime adventure, which I am yet to fulfil.  As a 90s kid, I learned about Hawaii from the animated Disney movie Lilo & Stitch, released in 2002. However, back then, it only seemed like a fictional place because it looked too good to be true.\
Well, yes, Hawaii is a tropical state island consisting of 137 smaller volcanic islands in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It has a beautiful coastline and enormous volcanic mountains, and one of them, Mauna Kea, is taller than Mount Everest (if measured from the base). I may have already sparked your interest in Hawaii a little bit, but just before I move on, here are some extra number facts:

•	As of 2024, Hawaii’s **population** is estimated at around **1,446,146** [^1]\
•	As of 2023, their median household **income** is **$98,317** [^1a]\
•	They have the 4th longest ocean **coastline** in the U.S., measuring around **1,210** kilometres (750 miles) [^2]\
