Hi, I’m Joanna – an experienced data management professional and aspiring Data Analyst.

I’ve spent my career working with complex datasets, maintaining data integrity, and improving workflows to ensure efficiency and accuracy. In my current role as a Database Executive, I manage product information systems, collaborate across teams, and implement innovative solutions that streamline operations.

Now, as I pursue an NCFE Level 4 Diploma in Data Analysis, I’m building on my existing expertise to transition into a Data Analyst position. This qualification complements my hands-on experience in data relationships, structures, and governance, and adds advanced skills in data visualisation, mining, and statistical analysis.

What I bring to the table:
• Proven expertise in data integrity, master data management, and ERP system optimisation 
• A track record of leading teams and delivering successful data-driven projects
• Proficiency in tools like Excel, Power BI, SQL, and emerging programming skills in Python

What excites me most about data is its ability to uncover meaningful insights and drive impactful decisions. Whether it's creating efficient processes, automating tasks, or diving into the numbers to solve problems, I enjoy turning raw data into actionable results.

I’m always looking to connect with like-minded professionals and learn more about the latest developments in data analysis and management. If you’d like to collaborate, share advice, or explore opportunities, I’d love to hear from you!
